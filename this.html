    <!-- The Website will have multiple(?) sliders to adjust the difficulty of the hash as well as a text box for the user to input what they want to encrypt
    Also we have to figure out a way for the website to not have so much blank space all around the user input cuz that shit looks ugly as hell ngl
    Thats pretty much it i guess maybe we could add like an infographic section where the user learns about the uses and real life applications of hashes and stupid shit that no one gives half a fuck about -->
